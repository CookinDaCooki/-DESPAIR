Go to the yellow line at the opposite side of the room.
If you see a countdown hide in a gap in the walls
Most entities kill on contact
If there's a laser sound start rushing to the end,
If there's an eye stay still until it dissapears,
If theres a TV don't stand infront of it, or your charatcer will be "traumatized"
If you see a red and black circle coming at you move away, it will explode,
If you see a red dot pointing at you from the wall make sure you move up and down frequently,
Playing risky makes the game hard, he cautious and stay alive to room 50.
Good luck!
